A static website created for a fictional science museum, with pure HTML & CSS.

## Description
This site was created using pure HTML & CSS, to demonstrate how much we'd learned about those two languages. 

It's a static website designed by me, which is also responsive and WCAG-compliant.

I was tasked with creating a website for a local science museum aimed at inspiring children to become the next generation of scientists.
